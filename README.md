Entry point and container application for a micro frontends.

# Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`

You can run the container on its own, but for it to actually do anything you'll
also need to be running:

- the [`smartux`](https://github.com/micro-frontends-demo/content) server
- the [`coupon`](https://github.com/micro-frontends-demo/browse/) server
